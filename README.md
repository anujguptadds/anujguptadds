### Hi there 👋
I am Anuj Gupta, a Coding and Deep Learning enthusiast and a graduate from IIT Guwahati, majoring in Electronics and Electrical Engineering. I love writing code, and I am obsessed with the idea of using software to solve practical problems. Software engineering is a never-ending puzzle that I am passionately involved in solving.

I have experience as a summer intern at Samsung R&D Institute (2019), wherein I built applications leveraging Natural Language Processing. I also participated as a member of the technical team at the Robotics Club of IIT Guwahati and conceptualized multiple projects based on the applications of Robotics.

I have experience with Data Structures and Algorithms, Deep Learning, Computer Vision and Natural Language Processing. I am familiar with languages such as C, C++, Python, SQL, Matlab, and libraries including Tensorflow, Keras, Scikit-learn, Numpy, Pandas, NLTK, spaCy, etc.
