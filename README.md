### Hi there ðŸ‘‹
I am Anuj Gupta, a Coding and Deep Learning enthusiast and a graduate from IIT Guwahati, majoring in Electronics and Electrical Engineering. I love writing code, and I am obsessed with the idea of using software to solve practical problems. Software engineering is a never-ending puzzle that I am passionately involved in solving.

I have experience as a summer intern at Samsung R&D Institute (2019), wherein I built applications leveraging Natural Language Processing. I also participated as a member of the technical team at the Robotics Club of IIT Guwahati and conceptualized multiple projects based on the applications of Robotics.

I have experience with Data Structures and Algorithms, Deep Learning, Computer Vision and Natural Language Processing. I am familiar with languages such as C, C++, Python, SQL, Matlab, and libraries including Tensorflow, Keras, Scikit-learn, Numpy, Pandas, NLTK, spaCy, etc. 

I am always open to exciting and challenging opportunities in the fields like Data Science (Deep Learning, Computer Vision, Natural Language Processing), Quantitative Research, and software engineering roles involving cutting edge technologies. You can find my CV attached in this repository (anujguptadds/anujguptadds) to know more!
